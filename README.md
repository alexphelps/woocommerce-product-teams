# WooCommerce Product Teams

This WooCommerce extension adds a new taxonomy 'Teams' to Products that allows you to create "Team Stores" for your retail shop. The most likely use case is that you create customized clothing or products for teams or brands.

### Displaying Teams

Use the [product_teams] shortcode to output an index of all teams in your store that are **active** and **have at least one product**.
